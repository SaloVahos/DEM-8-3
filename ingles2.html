    GUIA DE TRABAJO – TALLER INTEGRADO <br><br>
    Eating Disorders <br><br>
Eating disorders are so common in America that 1 or 2 out every 100 students will struggle with one. The most common types of eating disorder are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (usually called simply “anorexia” and “bulimia”: But other food-related disorders, like binge eating disorders, body image disorders, and food phobias, are showing up more frequently than they used to. <br><br>
ANOREXIA <br>
People with anorexia have an extreme fear of weight gain and a distorted view of their body size and shape. As a result, they can’t maintain a normal body weight.
Some people with anorexia restrict their food intake by dieting, or excessive exercise. They hardly eat at all – and the small amount of food they do eat becomes an obsession.    Other people with eating disorders do something called binge eating and purging, where they eat a lot of food and then try to get rid of the calories by forcing themselves to vomit, using laxatives, or exercising excessively. <br><br>

BULIMIA <br>
Bulimia is similar to anorexia. With bulimia, a person binge eats (eats far too much food) and then tries to compensate it extreme ways, such as forced vomiting or excessive exercise, to prevent weight gain. Over time, these steps can be dangerous.  To be diagnosed with bulimia, a person must be binging and purging regularly, at least twice a week for a couple of months. People with bulimia eat a large amount of food (often junk food) at once, usually in secret. The person typically feels powerless to stop eating and can only stop once he or she is too full to eat any more. <br><br>
